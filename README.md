# GBDT transformation rule mining and Dynamic improvement for Land Use Simulation (GDLUS): A Multi-Source Data Integration Approach
---
This repository proposes GDLUSâ€”an enhanced land use simulation model that integrates multi-source datasets, a GBDT-based transformation rule mining module, and a dynamic improvement module. The model introduces three key innovations to form a more efficient and accurate simulation framework. 
1. (1) It incorporates multi-temporal land use data and multi-source driving factors, overcoming the input limitations of the original PLUS model and providing robust data support for long-term simulation and analysis.
 
2. (2) The model employs a GBDT algorithm to capture complex nonlinear relationships between land use changes and natural, socioeconomic and other multi-dimensional drivers, significantly improving the accuracy of land use conversion rule mining. 

3. (3) A dynamic improvement module is developed, integrating parameter extraction (i.e., dynamically extracting parameters from multi-year patterns to reduce subjectivity), target decomposition (i.e., breaks down macro demand into annual targets and uses spatial assessment to improve simulation efficiency), and weighted random sampling (i.e., adjusts parameters in real-time to align micro layouts with macro demands, enhancing accuracy while meeting overall targets). 
    
These innovations collectively establish a novel land use simulation framework that excels in modeling nonlinear relationships, enables long-term dynamic simulation and achieves high-precision representation of complex landscapes, offering a methodological advance for simulating human-land system evolution.
