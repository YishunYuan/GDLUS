# GDLUS
This repository proposes GDLUSâ€”an enhanced land use simulation model that integrates multi-source datasets, a GBDT-based transformation rule mining module, and a dynamic improvement module.  The model introduces three key innovations to form a more efficient and accurate simulation framework.
